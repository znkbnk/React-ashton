      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Established in 1925, we at Ashton & Moore have the experience and
        technical knowhow to undertake successfully a wide variety of finishing
        processes including plating, anodising, painting and electroplating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following a successful MBO in 2004 the company was relocated to a single
        story open plan factory in 2006, allowing much of the equipment to be
        replaced and provide a more logical, ergonomic layout. The new factory
        has achieved full re-accreditation from all existing customers and
        approval bodies including Nadcap. The company also achieved a smooth and
        successful I.P. site closure for the old site together with full I.P.
        approval for the new site. Proprietor managed, Ashton & Moore has
        remained one of the UK's leading aerospace and defence finishing
        services supplier.

        {" "}
        During the move to our new facility we not only maintained the levels of
        quality and service that our customers have come to expect but we
        improved our performance to the extent that the Directors of Ashton &
        Moore have been listed in the 2009 'Who's Who of successful businessmen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ashton & Moore continues to strive to achieve a cost effective
        responsive service for their customers. Our technicians, committed and
        experienced in this our specialised field, together with our new layout
        and equipment, ensures that we provide only the very best results,
        frequently exceeding the quality and delivery requirements of any
        manufacturer.
