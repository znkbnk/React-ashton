          is to be applied by the Company pursuant to the Contract. References
          herein to “finishing” and “finishing services” shall be deemed to

            General Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by a director
            of the Company these Conditions are the only terms on which the
            Company accepts any order or Goods for finishing. These Conditions
            apply to all orders, whether or not these Conditions were
            specifically referred to at the time of ordering, to the exclusion
            of all other terms and conditions including any contained in an
            acceptance of a quotation, a form of order or any other document
            issued by the Customer. Delivery of the Goods to the Company or
            collection of the Goods by the Company (as the case may be) shall be
            deemed to be conclusive evidence of the Customer's acceptance of
            these Conditions. The Company and the Customer acknowledge that the
            terms and conditions herein have been given due consideration and
            that they are considered fair and reasonable by both parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quotations and Order Unless previously withdrawn the Company's
            quotations are only open for acceptance within three months from the
            date thereof and where given without sight of the Goods are
            provisional only. Each order placed by the Customer for finishing by
            the Company shall be deemed to be an offer by the Customer to
            purchase finishing services subject to these Conditions. Without
            prejudice to condition 2(e) below, any representations to be binding
            upon the Company must be specifically agreed to in writing by the
            Company. The Customer acknowledges that save in the circumstances
            provided for in condition 2(c) above no representation whether oral
            or in writing has been made by any of the Company's agents
            representatives or employees which has led the Customer to enter
            into the Contract. Specifications, descriptions and illustrations
            contained in the Company's catalogues, brochures or other
            advertising materials in whatever form, whether hard copy format,
            electronic format or otherwise, are intended to give only a general
            idea of the services concerned and the possible result of any
            finishing and none of these shall form any part of the Contract or
            form any warranty or representation by the Company. The Company may
            make any changes to the specification, materials or finishes which
            are required to conform with any applicable safety or other
            statutory requirements. No order placed by the Customer which the
            Company has accepted may be cancelled or varied by the Customer
            except with the written agreement of the Company. The Customer shall
            be liable for all losses (including loss of profit) costs, damages,
            charges and expenses suffered or incurred by the Company as a result
            of such cancellation or variation. After examination of samples of
            the Goods in bulk the Company has the right to amend any quotation
            or decline to accept Goods for finishing or not to proceed with any
            order, without any further liability to the Customer. The Company
            may by giving notice to the Customer at any time up to receipt of
            the Goods by the Company for finishing increase any price quoted to
            reflect any increase in the cost of finishing which is due to any
            increase in cost of labour, materials or other manufacturing costs
            and transport costs. Unless otherwise stated prices are quoted
            exclusive of VAT.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ownership The Customer hereby warrants that it is either the owner
            of the Goods delivered to or accepted by the Company for finishing
            or that it is authorised by such owner to accept these Conditions on
            such owner's behalf.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transportation of Goods If the price quoted by the Company includes
            transport of the Goods to and from the Company's works the Company
            will arrange transport by whatever method the Company considers
            appropriate (which may be transport by a third party carrier, rather
            than by the Company). The Goods will be at the Customer's risk
            during such transport to and from the Company's Works and the
            Customer will insure the Goods at all times during such transport.
            Neither the Company nor any third party carrier utilised by the
            Company shall be liable for the loss or destruction of or damage to
            Goods in transit whether as a result of its or their negligence or
            otherwise. If the price quoted does not include transport of the
            Goods to and from the Company's works the Customer undertakes at its
            own expense and risk both to deliver the Goods to the Company's
            works on the date and at the time notified by the Company and to
            collect them within 5 days after notification by the Company that
            the finishing has been completed. The Customer shall be responsible
            for the adequate packing of the Customer's Goods in transit to
            protect them against weather conditions, impact damage and other
            transport risks and for the provision of suitable stillages, pallets
            and other containers. The Customer shall use such packing materials
            as are suitable for re-use by the Company when returning the Goods
            to the Customer. No warranty whatsoever is given by the Company that
            packing materials, cases, cartons and pallets will be returned to
            the Customer but wherever possible these will be returned to the
            Customer with the Goods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Variation in Prices In the event of suspension of work on the Goods
            at the Customer's request or through the inadequacy or inaccuracy of
            the Customer's instructions, any price quoted by the Company may be
            increased to cover any additional costs or expenses incurred by the
            Company as a result thereof. If the Customer does not indicate to
            the Company plainly and correctly the type of Goods, including the
            make, brand, and grade of Goods to which finishing is to be applied
            and/or fails to give to the Company correct and complete
            instructions as to the processing, including the specification,
            required, the Customer shall be liable for any additional costs or
            expenses incurred by the Company and any loss or profit, loss of
            business or loss of use of processing lines suffered by the Company
            as a direct or indirect result thereof. When prices are quoted which
            include delivery to and/or collection of the Goods from any delivery
            address outside the United Kingdom, any increase in insurance,
            packing or freight costs, import duty, internal taxes or any other
            charges incidental to the delivery of the Goods between the date of
            the Contract and the date of delivery and/or collection (as the case
            may be), together with all costs of any trans-shipment and/or
            deviation of voyage shall be paid by the Customer. The Customer
            shall be liable for all costs charges and expenses whatsoever in
            connection with the opening, advising, confirmation, negotiation and
            operation of any letter of credit, the transfer of cash to the
            Company and the release of any shipping documents. The cost of any
            variation or modification to the order requested by the Customer
            after the date of the acceptance of order shall, if such variation
            or modification is accepted by the Company, be borne by the
            Customer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unsuitability of Goods for Metal Finishing It shall be the
            Customer's responsibility to ensure that the Goods are suitable for
            finishing. However if at any stage the Company in its sole
            discretion considers that the Goods are unsuitable for finishing
            (or, if finishing has begun, for further finishing) whether in
            accordance with the Company's quotation or otherwise, the Company
            will advise the Customer as soon as is reasonably practicable and
            shall be entitled to discontinue finishing forthwith. The Company
            shall thereupon notify the Customer of the Company's outstanding
            charges in respect of finishing carried out up to the date of such
            discontinuance and the Customer shall pay the same within 28 days of
            the date of such notification. Unless the Company agrees in writing
            to arrange transport the Customer will collect the Goods at its own
            expense and risk from the Company's works as soon as possible
            following notification of the discontinuance of the finishing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carrying Out of Work Any times quoted for completion of the Contract
            are to be treated as estimates only. The Company shall not be liable
            for any loss (including loss of profit, costs, damages or expenses
            arising directly or indirectly out of any delay in delivery or
            failure to complete the Contract within such time, even if caused by
            the Company's negligence) and time shall not be of the essence. Such
            times quoted shall run from receipt by the Company of the Goods and
            of all information required by the Company in order to put the work
            in hand. In any event, the time for completion shall be extended by
            a reasonable period if completion of the finishing is delayed by the
            nature of or lack of instructions from the Customer, or by any cause
            beyond the Company's control.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sub-Contracting The Company may sub-contract the whole or any part
            of the finishing (unless specifically instructed otherwise in
            writing by the Customer, at or prior to the time the Contract is
            made) without affecting the Company's obligations under the
            Contract. The Company may also store all or any part of the Goods on
            premises other than the Company's premises.
          </li>
          <li>
            Force Majeure If the Company is in any way prevented from or delayed
            in performing any of the Company's obligations under the Contract by
            reason of decisions or actions of any Government or other authority,
            war or threat of war, fire, explosion, material damage to or failure
            of plant and equipment, severe weather conditions, materials
            shortages or inadequacies, interruption or reduction in
            communications or means of transport, power or utilities failure,
            failure or delay in obtaining materials required for finishing, any
            strikes, lock-outs or industrial disputes (whether or not involving
            the Company's work force), accident or any other cause beyond the
            Company's control the Company shall be entitled at the Company's
            absolute discretion partially or totally to suspend performance of
            the Contract for a period equal to the delay caused by such events
            and shall be in no way liable for such failure to perform its
            obligations under the Contract or for such delay. If the period for
            performance of the Contract is extended as a result of such
            suspension by more than one month the Contract may be terminated (as
            regards any Goods which have not undergone finishing) by either
            party by written notice to the other but such termination shall be
            without prejudice to the Company's rights to require the Customer to
            take delivery of and/or collect any Goods and to pay for the
            finishing of such Goods as are or may be available for delivery
            and/or collection and without prejudice to any rights which may have
            accrued to either party prior to the date of such termination.
            Furthermore if the Company is unable to meet the demands of all its
            customers as a result of any such event the Company may allocate the
            available capacity for finishing Goods among such customers as the
            Company in its absolute discretion considers fit and without
            incurring any liability whatsoever to any customers of the Company.
          </li>
          <li>
            Payment Terms Unless otherwise agreed in writing, payment in full of
            all sums due under the Contract shall be made in pounds sterling (or
            such other currency as the Company shall specify) within 30 days
            following the date of notification to the Customer that the
            finishing has been completed or (if the price includes transport) of
            delivery of the Goods following finishing to the Customer. Time for
            payment shall be of the essence. Without prejudice to the Company's
            other rights and remedies, interest shall be payable at the rate of
            4% per annum above the base rate from time to time and shall accrue
            from day to day on all overdue payments (as well after as before
            judgement). Any payment due under the Contract shall be made in full
            without any deduction whether by way of set off, counterclaim or
            otherwise unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing or
            unless the Customer has a valid court order requiring an amount
            equal to such deduction to be paid by the Company to the Customer.
            Where the Company specifies that payment will be made by letter of
            credit, the Customer must establish and maintain in favour of the
            Company an irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit with or
            confirmed by a bank satisfactory to the Company. No delivery or
            collection of Goods will take place until a letter of credit has
            been opened and the Company is satisfied with all arrangements
            relating thereto. If for any reason the bank is liable to make
            payment to the Company under any letter of credit established for
            that purpose and fails to do so the Customer shall nevertheless
            remain liable to pay for the finishing of the Goods.Each Contract
            shall be subject to the Company being satisfied as to the Customer's
            credit status both prior to and during the period of the Contract.
            If the Company becomes dissatisfied with the Customer's credit
            status at any time, the Company may suspend performance of the
            Contract or withhold delivery until the Customer satisfies the
            Company as to the Customer's creditworthiness or gives the Company
            such security as the Company shall deem appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Duties and Responsibility The Customer is reminded of the associated
            hazards and effects of finishing, including (but not limited to)
            distortion, thread damage, overprocessing, chemical attack to base
            material, oven failure, mechanical damage during masking, electrical
            arcing during processing, embrittlement of high tensile steels and
            contamination of Goods in bulk processing. The Customer hereby
            acknowledges that the Contract is entered into in full knowledge
            awareness and acceptance of such hazards and effects. The Company
            warrants that it will carry out its obligations under the Contract
            with reasonable care and skill. This warranty shall be the only
            warranty given in respect of such obligations. All other conditions
            and warranties express or implied by statute common law or otherwise
            are hereby excluded. Subject to condition 11(h) below, the Company
            shall not in any event be liable for any breach of the warranty
            given in condition.
          </li>

          <li>
            Above or for any breach of the Contract or breach of statutory duty
            or tort (including but not limited to negligence) misrepresentation
            or otherwise including, without limitation, failure to provide
            matching between different batches or for any damage to or loss of
            Goods as a result of finishing by the Company:
          </li>
          <li>
            Unless the methods employed in manufacturing the Goods prior to
            finishing pursuant to the Contract have taken into account the
            current state of knowledge in the finishing industry and the
            Customer has ensured that the Goods are made from the correct
            material and designed to appropriate engineering standards and have
            not been subject to any process or treatment by any person other
            than the Company which renders them unsuitable for finishing and
            full information concerning the Goods as referred to in condition
            5(b) above has been supplied to the Company before the commencement
            of finishing; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Unless the Customer checks the quantity of Goods delivered to or
            collected by the Customer forthwith and notifies the Company in
            writing of any alleged shortfall of, damage to, or incorrect
            finishing of the Goods within 14 days thereafter in the case of
            defects which are reasonably obvious on inspection and in any event
            within 6 months of delivery; and (iii) unless the Customer
            thereafter affords the Company a reasonable opportunity to inspect
            the Goods and if so requested by the Company returns the allegedly
            damaged Goods or the Goods the subject of allegedly incorrect
            finishing to the Company's works at the Customer's expense for
            inspection to take place there; and (iv) unless the Customer has
            made no use of the Goods alleged to be damaged or the subject of
            allegedly incorrect finishing after it discovers or ought reasonably
            to have discovered that they were damaged or the subject of
            incorrect finishing; and (v) if the Goods have been subjected to
            misuse or improperly or incorrectly stored after delivery to or
            collection by the Customer; and (vi) unless and only to the extent
            that the allegedly damaged Goods or the Goods the subject of
            allegedly incorrect finishing exceed 2% of each batch (in the case
            of jigged or rack processed Goods) and 5% of each batch (in the case
            of bulk processed Goods) (losses of up to 5% of each batch being
            accepted as normal in the industry in processing large quantities of
            small parts). The Company shall be under no obligation to ensure
            that any Goods are an exact match, or that one batch exactly matches
            another whether the colour or finish are defined by reference to a
            sample or by description. Where a colour or finish is specified in
            the Contract by reference to a sample or description the Customer
            shall accept as complying with the Contract all Goods which are a
            commercial match with the sample or correspond with the description,
            as the case may be, and are a commercial match with each other in
            accordance with the standard generally recognised in the industry.
            In the light of the great disparity between the value of the Goods
            undergoing finishing and the charge for finishing made by the
            Company, the liability of the Company for any breach of the warranty
            given in condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Above and for any breach of the Contract or breach of statutory duty
            or tort (including but not limited to negligence) misrepresentation
            or otherwise is limited to three times the charge made for finishing
            of the relevant Goods under the Contract. In the case of breach of
            the warranty given in condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Above, instead of refunding or waiving the whole or the appropriate
            part of the charge for finishing the Company may at its option take
            such steps as the Company considers necessary so as to comply with
            the said warranty and thereupon this shall be the Company's only
            liability in respect of such breach of warranty. The Company shall
            not under any circumstances be liable for loss of profit, loss of
            use, loss of business or loss of goodwill including (but not limited
            to) delay in delivery, or for any indirect or consequential loss,
            injury or damage of any kind whether caused by negligence or
            otherwise howsoever and whether or not such loss has been suffered
            by the Customer or by some third party to whom the Customer may be
            liable and whether or not such loss has been caused by reason of the
            Goods infringing any patent, registered or unregistered design,
            copyright, trade mark or service mark owned by a third party. Goods
            are and remain at all times whilst at the Company's works at the
            entire risk of the Customer who shall be responsible for effecting
            and maintaining its own insurance cover in relation thereto, it
